# Android101
These are finished exercises from my "Android 101" workshop at Pentasys.
Just check out the root project with Android Studio or IntelliJ and you should be good to go.

Please contact me at <a href="mailto:ingo.freitag@pentasys.de>ingo.freitag@pentasys.de</a> if you have any problems or questions.

Happy coding!
